Marketing
=========

You might not believe it, but you can help in marketing. After reading this
page, you will know how.

Publicity
---------

The best project is useless if nobody knows or cares about it. That is
where you come in. To make your efforts as effective as possible, we will
give you some tips on this page.

Target Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, here it is: The evil word of publishers or an effective means to target
marketing to the right set of people. Every project offers multiple possible
target groups. For the most part of the initial development, this project
will only be interesting to developers. Therefore you should focus on this
group.

The best way to reach developers next to personal contact are conferences.
Of course you should not participate in a conference (and pay the related
fee) just for this project. But if you already participate on a conference
for other reasons, it'd be nice to present this project to fellow developers.

That said, it doesn't hurt the project if you tell your non-developer
friends about it.

Marketing material
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Words are nice and sometimes very effective but most people won't be
convinced by mere words. They want hard facts or at least a presentation
that gives them the feeling that the project representatives know what they
are doing. We need marketing material to cater the need of these people.

This marketing material can and should be used by you but you can create
marketing material yourself. All the marketing material should be pushed
to the 'marketing' directory in the meta repository. Marketing presentations
should be created with LaTeX Beamer. If you create other presentations,
use only LibreOffice Impress to ensure that every contributor, regardless of
the used operating system, can use these presentations.

Corporate Identity
------------------

Another aspect of marketing is a unified public appearance. The goal is to
build up both the name 2martens and the web platform itself. Therefore all
public presentations and websites marketing the project, should follow a
common design principle. This principle has been set with the already created
logo.

Social Media
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of the corporate identity, the social media channels will be branded
under the same visual language. Currently there is only a Twitter account and
other social media channels are neither planned nor endorsed. The channels
will be served with content by the project founder, since it is his
personal Twitter account.
