The developer documentation is an essential part of every big and successful
project. Therefore it is vital to start early on and develop it at the same
time as the code is written. Whenever a feature is completed and ready
to be merged into the master branch, the corresponding documentation pull
request will also be merged.

After this short introductory text you will find a list of all the
documentation pages that have been written so far.
