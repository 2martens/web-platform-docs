Good, you want to help us improve and extend the documentation. Take a look into the issue tracker and take one of the
issues. If there are none, you can help us by going through the existing documentation and writing down all issues that
you see with it. Be it for typos or for more severe problems, create issues for them in the tracker. Then go back to 
the beginning of this paragraph. Rinse and repeat.
